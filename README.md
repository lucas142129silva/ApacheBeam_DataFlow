# **Apache Beam Data Flow**
****

Data Processing with Apache Beam from a **csv archive with a great amount of data**.

The main goal of the project is to transform the input data into clean output data,
to be able to create analysis using Data Science. To achieve this, it will
create a pipeline to **extract**, **transform** and **clean** the input data.

Thus, a simple data analysis with the output data is done, using pandas and matplotlib / seaborn for data visualization.
